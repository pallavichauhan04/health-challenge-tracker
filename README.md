### Instructions for Including 100% Code Coverage

Ensure that your unit tests for both components and services have 100% code coverage. To achieve this, make sure:

1. **All functions and methods in your components and services are tested.**
2. **There are tests for all branches and conditions.**

You can check the code coverage report after running your tests with `ng test`. The report will be available in the `coverage` folder, and you can open `coverage/index.html` to verify the coverage statistics.
